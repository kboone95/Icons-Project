    <h1>Singer-Songwriter Art Auré Speaks About Her Uplifting Music and Its Influences<h1>

          <p> Soulful rising star and D.C. native Art Auré has a voice and energy that are unmatched. A singer-songwriter who attended the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, she recently released her motivational single “Keep On.” She spoke with City
            Paper about the message behind the song, and provided a glimpse into her musical influences.

          <p>WCP: When was the moment that you knew music was your calling?
            <p />

          <p>AA: I knew music was my calling around the age of 6 or 7 years old. My parents are originally from Gary, Indiana, so Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5 have been in our household, playing in the stereos and car and everything. I saw The
            Jacksons: An American Dream. Once I saw Jason Weaver and all of the other amazing actors, I was like, I have to do that. I started writing songs actually when I was 6, and when I discovered that I can sing, I just kept doing it. That was
            the thing that made me happy, and when something makes you happy, it’s like, you gotta roll with it.
            <p />

          <p>WCP: Your song was chosen as a theme for Black Women for Biden leading up to the election. How do you feel about his choice of running mate Sen. Kamala Harris?
            <p />

          <p>AA: I love it! I love the fact that Joe Biden chose a woman of color to be his running mate. For one, history is being made. You don’t see that. We’ve never seen that in our country, at least. That means that change is coming and we have
            to keep on. I really feel like people are going to use their common sense and change is inevitable, especially now. How do you not choose somebody that’s for the people?
            <p />

          <p>WCP: You’ve been a show opener. How do you mentally prepare for a performance knowing that you are setting the tone for the rest of the show?
            <p />
          <p>AA: It comes with years of doing it. You’re always going to have nerves. It’s just like practice, the more you do it, your muscle memory becomes more prevalent in your body and starts to form its tone and shape when you do it for so
            long.
            The nerves are never going to go away. I’m sure you heard people say if you don’t have nerves, it’s not a good thing.
